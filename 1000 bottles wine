 King has 1000 bottles of wine to be consumed in a party after 7 days. Palace guards found one of the bottles was poisoned by a spy. King wants rest 999 bottles in the party 
 and for that the poisonous bottle has to be identified and discarded. King has given 10 prisoners whom you can test. 
 
 
  2 strategies could be followed for this problem.
............................................................ 
 
 #1. We can be identify the poisionous bottle within 7 days and 99 seconds.
    Divide the 1000 bottles in group of 10 with 100 each. Number the each bottle from 1 to 1000 and each prisioner from 1 to 10.
    
   Take first prisoner and let him have a sip from first bottle.
   After 1 sec
   Take same prisoner and let him have a sip from second bottle.
   Again After 1 sec
   Take Same prisoner and let him have sip from third bottle.
   SIMILARLY
    The prisoner will have sip from 99 bottles in gap of 1-1 sec.
    
    And Similarly all the 10 prisoners will follow same procedure at the same time. And record the time for everyone.
    
    If After 1 week , first prisoner dies…then 1st bottle is poisoned…
    If After 1 week and 1 sec , first prisoner dies…then 2nd bottle is poisoned…
    If After 1 week and 2 sec , first prisoner dies…then 3nd bottle is poisoned…
    ...
    If After 1 week and 2 sec, second prisoner dies…then 102nd bottle is poisoned…
    
    This will find out the bottle but with some extra seconds after 1 week.
    *This is also possible with just 1 prisioner but that will take 1 week and 999 seconds to identify the bottle.
    
 .......................................................   
    
    #2. By converting into binary numbers
      
      Number the bottles 1 to 1000 and write the number in binary format.
      bottle 1 = 0000000001 (10 digit binary)
      bottle 2 = 0000000010
      bottle 500 = 0111110100
      
      Also take 10 prisoners and number them 1 to 10, now let prisoner 1 take a sip from every bottle that has a 1 in its least significant bit. Let prisoner 10 take a
      sip from every bottle with a 1 in its most significant bit. etc.

      prisoner = 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1

      bottle 755 = 1 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 1
      
       for eg. if bottle no. 755 would be sipped by 10,8,7,6,5,4,2 and 1. That way if bottle no. 755 was the poisoned one, only those prisoners would die.
      
      After one week, line the prisoners up in their bit order and read each living prisoner as a 0 bit and each dead prisoner as a 1 bit. The number that we get
      is the bottle of wine that was poisoned.
